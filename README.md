## What it is

A drum machine project from [freecodecamp's frontend certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine). The drum machine has 9 clickable drum pad elements, each has an HTML5 audio clip that is triggered when clicked. The power toggle switch can be used to turn on/off the drum pad by disabling all buttons. The volume turns the volume all the up or down and each button becomes disabled when max or minimum volumes are reached.
